# Abalone Board Game

This project is a board game called Abalone. I created the code for it in my free time as a hobby and personal challenge. I used React and the programming languages CSS, HTML and TypeScript to create this project to familiarise myself with React and the languages.

Abalone is a turn-based game in which 2 players compete against each other.
Each of them has 14 marbles that they can move on the board.
They are moved either alone or with up to 3 marbles at the same time to the same direction with empty hexagon(s).
Additionally, a player can move the opponent's marble(s) by collapsing them in a straight line with more marbles than the opponent's marble(s) while there is an empty hexagon or the end of the board behind the opponent's marble. Then all these marbles are moved in the same direction.
The goal is to move 6 of the opponent's marbles out of the board to win the game.

My project is not accessible online, but can be played locally by downloading the code and looking at the "Getting Started" section below.
If you want to play it online on an official website (developed by Board Game Arena), you should visit this website:

The publisher of the official game is Asmodee:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
